### What I learned

grid area is the best thing about this project

```css
.con1-div1 {
    grid-area: 1 / 1 / 1 / 3;
    background: hsl(263, 55%, 52%);

    background-image: url(./images/bg-pattern-quotation.svg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: top right 70px;
}

.con1-div2 {
    grid-area: 1 / 3 / 1 / 4;
    background: hsl(217, 19%, 35%);
}

.con1-div3 {
    grid-area: 2 / 1 / 2 / 2;
    background: white;
}

.con1-div4 {
    grid-area: 2 / 2 / 2 / 4;
    background: hsl(219, 29%, 14%);
}

.con1-div5 {
    grid-area: 1 / 4 / 3 / 4;
    background: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

### Continued development

I have completed this project in every way and also make it responsive for 3 devices. Now I would like to work on the other projects.
