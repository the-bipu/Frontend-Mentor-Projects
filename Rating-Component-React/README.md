## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React JS

### What I learned

In this project i have learned some of the new topics like how to add some classes in a div on the userClick.

```js
<div className={isActive ? "container2 activeContainer2" : "container2"}>
```

### Continued development

The responsive parts are missing in this project so i would like to focus on it from the next project and also i'll complete my vanilla CSS Rating Component Design and make it responsive.
